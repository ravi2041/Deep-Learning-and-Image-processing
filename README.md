# Histopathology-IDC-detection-using-CNN
IDC is the most phenotypic subtype of all the breast cancers (BCa) comprising nearly 80% of them. IDC is usually identified by pathologists through visual analysis of tissue slides stained with H&E (Hematoxylin & Eosin). Through this research, focus was to improve the existing CNN results and to further explore whether different color spaces help improve the classification recall score.If yes, which color based feature spaces amongst the four -HSV, RGB, YUV or YCRCB,when used alongwith basic CNN and pre trained VGG 16 CNN models would perform the best in classifying a patch containing IDC or not.Our results show that RGB and YUV gave us the best recall score.
